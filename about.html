            Nice Guys is an application designed to protect women and men from predatory partners.
            The team originally thought of the idea while trying to appease our seratonin starved 
            brains. In search of memes that would quench the never ending thirst, we came across a
            page with dating app freakouts from rejected Kyles and Samanthas (no offense if you're 
            a normal Kyle or Samantha). We wanted to give the good people of the internet a way to 
            date a little safer, so we came up with Nice Guys. Our aim is to give prospective 
            singles a way to look up a person online, associate that person with a dating app, and
            find out if they are going to be a potentially harmful individual. Users will be allowed 
            to uploaded images without an account, but they will need an account to view images, so 
            please, make an account. It will be free, and it could save your life.
